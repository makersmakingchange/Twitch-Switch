Parts J2, J3, XA1, and SW1 are populated by the user and will not be assembled by JLCPCB.
Part J3 is not depicted in "Component Placement.pdf" because it is on the bottom of the PCB.
Paste should not be placed on A0, A1, and A2 jumpers below U1. This is for user configuration and will be soldered by the user for multi-channel use.
