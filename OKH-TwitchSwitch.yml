title: Twitch Switch
description: The Twitch Switch is an assistive technology for users with limited movement
  capabilities. Up to three small wireless sensors can capture very small
  movements. The Twitch Switch can be used for activating up to three switch
  adapted devices or emulating a mouse or keyboard to operate a digital device
  such as a computer.
intended-use: The Twitch Switch is intended primarily for people who have some controlled,
  repeatable, intentional movement, but otherwise have limited mobility and/or
  dexterity. This device may be beneficial for users with cerebral palsy (CP),
  spinal cord injuries (SCI), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular
  dystrophy (MD), locked-in syndrome (LIS), traumatic brain injury (TBI), or
  other disabilities or conditions that significantly limit movement.
